magman - "Magazine Manager"
===========================
magman is a tutorial application developed in the article "ATK - A Business Framework" by Ivo Jansch, published under the same name in the September 2008 issue of php|architect.

To Get Started
==============
Refer to either the original php|architect article.

Communication Channels
======================
ATK developers discuss problems and solutions, keep each other informed, and generally help each other out, on the [Achievo/ATK forum](http://forum.achievo.org/). Please consider creating a free user profile on the forum; you will need a user profile to post or reply (viewing does not require a profile). Having a profile also enables you to be sent an email notice when someone replies to one of your posts (or creates a new post), and color-codes posts to show the ones you haven't read yet.

If you create a new forum topic, be careful to submit it to the ATK forum.

Documentation
=============
Refer to the tutorial article.

Support
=======
In the event you have a problem:

* Post an issue to the magman GitHub issue tracker.
* Post a question to the [ATK forum](http://forum.achievo.org/) (free account sign-up is required for posting).

To get the most informed response when posting, please try to include:

* What are you trying to achieve?
* What are the symptoms of your problem? Why do you think there *is* a problem?
* What is your server (OS, web server, PHP and MySQL)? E.g. FreeBSD 9.1, Apache 2.2.22, PHP 5.3.10 and MySQL 5.5.20.
* Include example code (the *simplest* code that demonstrates the symptoms).
